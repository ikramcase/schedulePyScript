To run the Go microservice, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Install Go: Make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the official Go website (https://golang.org/) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2. Set up your project directory: Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.

3. Create a Go module: In the project directory, run the following command to initialize a Go module:
   ```
   go mod init schedulePyScript
   ```
4. Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

5. Build and run the schedulePyScript: Execute the following command to build and run the Go microservice:
   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

6. The microservice will start running and listen on `http://localhost:8080`. You can test the endpoints using tools like cURL, Postman, or any web browser.

7. Use the endpoints to interact with the microservice: You can use the following REST API endpoints to manage jobs:

   - `POST /jobs` to create a new job (provide JSON payload with job details).
   - `GET /jobs` to retrieve all jobs.
   - `GET /jobs/:id` to retrieve a specific job by ID.
   - `PUT /jobs/:id` to update a specific job by ID (provide JSON payload with updated job details).
   - `DELETE /jobs/:id` to delete a specific job by ID.

   You can use cURL or a REST client like Postman to send requests to these endpoints.

Please note that this is a basic setup for running the Go microservice. You may need to modify the code or add additional features based on your specific requirements.
